# Welcome to the MCSync Permissions Configuration file! 
# MCSync Permissions does the same things as the base MCSync plugin, however this version will allow you to
#  assign users to specific LuckPerms groups, or give them a specific LuckPerms Permission Node for use in other plugins, such as Skript .
#
# This plugin requires the use of the MCSync Discord Bot in your Discord Server. Please make sure you
#  set that up as you will need the API token it generates for you. 
#

token: KEYHERE

# Additional Parameters are as follows;
# You can have multiple parameters set at the same time, for example, you can have 
#  parameters: debug perms
#
# debug - This will output additional information to the console.
# 2way - This will enable 2 way communication with the MCSync API for additional support.
#        Please only enable this if instructed by MCSync Support. 
# perms - This will disable the Access Control of MCSync and only manage permissions.
